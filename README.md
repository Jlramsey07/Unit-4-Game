# Unit-4-Game

This game originated from the Crystal game idea.
I changed the theme to something more personal to me becuse of where i work.
The concept is simple, each rocket has a random value and you must click on 1 of the four in hopes of reaching the target value withput going over.
I took me some time to be able to complete this game. 
Java and jquery are still very new to me and i have been struggling a bit.
A tutor helped assist me with the completion.
Functions and creating random variables are the two main concepts here.
